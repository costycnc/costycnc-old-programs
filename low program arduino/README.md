Story of Arduino begin with this board:  
![alt text](https://github.com/costycnc/costycnc-old-programs/blob/master/low%20program%20arduino/board.jpg)
based on this Atmega328 microcontroller

The board has heart Atmega328 and some aditional components that help Atmega328 to comunicate better with outside world .
on the board is a component that permit to comunicate with pc, a regulator can permit powered until 12volt (atmega328 resist until 5volt),
 leds,connectors, button for reset,a crystal for better stability , ecc ... so ... you can use Atmega328 alone but better is to use with board because have a lot or facilities!
 But arduino not divented popular if it did not haved a platform with can make program for this.Name of this platform is Arduino IDE.

 https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software you can install arduino IDE in your computer or can make programs online!!!
 But Arduino Ide not stop to make programs for his board ... Arduino Ide continued to make programs for another boards that not have anything in common with Atmega328 and his family!
 For example Arduino IDE can make program for ESP8266(wifi)

 and ESP32(wifi+bluettoth)

 a powerful boards based on advanced and much much  powerfully micocontrolers than atmega328 family!!!
 In theory looks good ... but in practice is not like that ... because more advanced processor divend more complicated to create programs for them.
