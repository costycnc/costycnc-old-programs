, but single not can work with another external boards because not have enough power,can not comunicate,ecc... for this is mounting on a board together with other components The general name of these intelligent piece of plastic is microcontroller and program with can write code for microcontroler is called IDE (integrated development environment) https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/.../integra


Knowing how to use Arduino or in general "intelligent" boards is a high advantage for you , but Unfortunately need to have some advanced Knowledge about microcontrolers,computers,programs,ecc...

For begginer only to make the Arduino to flash a led is a sophisticated adventure ... because the begginer need to install programs corectly, need to set many parameters of programs correctly, need to know how install libraries, need to have correct libraries, need to select from menu the correct port,correct baud,... tons of things that only one is a mistake ... crash all with error!

I encouradged to use Arduino board and Arduino IDE also I encouradged to study the tutorials made available by Arduino and For these that use and understand Arduino Ide or another ide I congratulate them ... but for those who did not make yet to make the LED blinking and they lost hope I want to bring back they hope that can do it.
